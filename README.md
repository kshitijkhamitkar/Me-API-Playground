# Me-API Playground

## Architecture

* **Frontend**: React (client/) → deployed on Vercel/Netlify.
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express (server/) → deployed on Render/Railway.
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas.

Flow:
Client (React) ⇄ Backend (Express API) ⇄ MongoDB Atlas.

---

## Setup

### Local Development

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Me-API-playground
   ```
2. Install dependencies for backend:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
3. Create `.env` inside `server/`:

   ```
   PORT=4000
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-atlas-uri>
   ```
4. Start backend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev   # if using nodemon
   # or
   npm start
   ```
5. Install dependencies for frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
6. Open: `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) & `http://localhost:4000` (backend).

### Production

* **Backend**: Deploy `server/` to Render/Railway.

  * Root Directory = `server`
  * Build Command = `npm install`
  * Start Command = `npm start`
  * Add `MONGO_URI` and `PORT` in environment settings.
* **Frontend**: Deploy `client/` to Vercel/Netlify.

  * Update `API_BASE` in frontend to your deployed backend URL.

## Schema (Example)

Profile Schema (`models/Profile.js`):

```js
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  bio: String,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

---

## Sample API Requests

### Create Profile

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-backend-url>/api/profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","bio":"Hello World"}'
```

### Get All Profiles

```bash
curl https://<your-backend-url>/api/profile
```

(You can also import the included Postman collection file for testing.)

---

## Known Limitations

* No authentication/authorization implemented yet.
* Error handling is minimal.
* Basic schema, can be extended for production needs.

Do you also want me to create the **Postman collection JSON** so you can just add it to your repo?
